# yahpot
Yet Another HTTP(S) HoneyPot

Simple, under 90 lines, yet functional honeypot with syslog and file-based logging. 

usage: yahpot.py [-h] [-t {http,https}] [-d DECOY] [-f FILE] [-l LOG] [-p PORT] [-k KEYFILE] [-c CERTFILE]

In /queries/ there are few KQL queries I'm using with Sentinel. You may find them useful.
